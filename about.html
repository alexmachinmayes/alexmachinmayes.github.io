						<p>
							CartoTopia was founded by Alex Machin-Mayes in 2018. Alex is a cartographer and GIS specialist with a background in Geography and ArcGIS. He is currently working on his Master's degree in GIS &amp; Web Map Programming from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Go Badgers!). 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Growing up in Seattle during the end of the 20th century - enormous demographic and urban expansion was taking place - and he became intrigued by the processes and patterns of development. After high school, Alex began travelling abroad. Exploring and learning about other cities, countries, cultures, and people - as well as his passion for maps, inspired him to return to school and pursue the study of Human Geography and GIS.   
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							In 2012, Alex graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Human Geography and a Minor in GIS from Western Washington University. As an undergraduate, he focused on Human Geography &amp; Urbanization and conducted a study analyzing urban growth in Whatcom County, WA. Using ArcGIS and U.S. Census data, he calculated and mapped the changes in housing density from 1990-2010. The research, literature review (summarized), maps, models, and diagrams generated from this study are available on the <a class="notwhitetext" href="https://alexmachinmayes.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> site he built during the study.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Since graduating, Alex has worked professionally as an independent GIS contractor, and as a GIS Property Specialist for the Land Management Department of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. In these positions he gained considerable experience in cartography, geodatabase management, spatial analysis techniques, and ArcGIS Online (AGOL). He has worked with many tribal government departments; and regularly provided GIS products and support to Planning, Real Estate, Emergency Services, Environmental Protection, Administration, Archives, Archaeology, Communications, Housing, Public Works, and Utilities, as well as non-profit organizations and contractors. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Needless to say, Alex loves maps. When he is not making them, he enjoys home-recording and guitar, woodworking, fixing things, and disc golf. Also, living in Bellingham, WA, he skis and snowboards at Mount Baker (naturally). Mount Baker ski area is home to the world record for snowfall with 1,140" in one seaon ('98-99')!
